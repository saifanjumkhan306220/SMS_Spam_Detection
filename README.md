# SMS_Spam_Detection
The world of unwanted spam sms can cause real problems, compromise privacy and potentially expose users to fraud. So I created a solution using machine learning(Logistic Regression) to solve this problem directly. Achieving a 95% success rate. The model can distinguish between spam and legitimate sms by leveraging natural language processing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, TF-IDF.

I have used Streamlit to implement over flask because it is simple and easy to deploy and no need to worry regarding web development. With just a few lines of code, I created a user-friendly website where users could enter a message and instantly guess whether it was SPAM or HAM.

I rigorously evaluate the model's performance using indicators such as accuracy, precision and confusion matrix. Among other algorithms such as Naive Bayes and decision trees, logistic regression emerged as the best solution.

Ensuring user privacy and security is a priority throughout the project. By using SMS spam classifier we not only reduce spam concerns, but also protect users from privacy breaches and fraud. The project demonstrates the power of machine learning to improve everyday knowledge. By reducing the impact of unnecessary spam, we create a safer, more enjoyable experience for everyone.
